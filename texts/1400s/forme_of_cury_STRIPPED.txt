_Sury_, and _Sure_, and _de Sur_. II. 19. de Syry, 31. and here No.
37, it is Dessorre. and we have _Samon in Sorry_. Lel. Coll. VI. p.
17. Perches, ibid. Eels p. 28. 30. where it is a Potage. whence I
conceive it either means _de Surrey_, i. e. Syria, v. Chaucer. v.
_Surrey_. Or it may mean _to be desired_, as we have _Horsys of
Desyr_. Lel. Coll. IV. p. 272. See No. 63. and it is plainly written
_Desire_ in Godwin de Præsul. p. 697. In this case, the others are
all of them corruptions.

Brawn of Capons. 20. 84. Flesh. Braun. MS. Ed. 29. v. Chaucer, we now
say, _brawn of the arm_, meaning the flesh. Hence _brawn-fall'n_.
Old Plays, XI. p. 85. Lylie's Euphues, p. 94. 142. Chaucer. Brawn is
now appropriated to these rolls which are made of Brawn or Boar, but
it was not so anciently, since in No. 32 we have _Brawn of Swyne_,
which shews the word was common to other kinds of flesh as well as
that of the Boar; and therefore I cannot agree with Dr. Wallis in
deducing _Brawn _ from _Aprugna_.

ad Chaucer. So called, says Skinner, who Writes it _mortress_,
because the ingredients are all pounded together in a mortar.

Moscels. 47. Morsels. Chaucer has _Morcills_. Moscels is not amiss,

ariseth; and in some manors _austrum_ or _ostrum_ is that, where a
fixed chimney or flew anciently hath been,' Ley, in Hearne's Cur.
Disc. p. 27. _Mannors_ here means, I suppose manor-houses, as is
common in the north. Hence _Haister_, for which see Northumb. Book, p.
415. 417. and Chaucer, v. Estris.

Noumbles. 11. 13. Entrails of any beast, but confined now to those
of a deer. I suspect a crasis in the case, quasi _an Umble_, singular

Porpays, Porpeys. 69. 108. salted, 116. roasted, 78. _Porpus_ or
Porpoise. _Porpecia_, Spelm. Gl. v. Geaspecia, which he corrects
_Seaspecia_. It is surprising he did not see it must be _Graspecia_
or _Craspiscis_, i.e. _Gros_ or _Crassus Piscis_, any large fish; a
common term in charters, which allow to religious houses or others
the produce of the sea on their coasts. See Du Cange in vocibus. We
do not use the Porpoise now, but both these and Seals occur in Archb.
Nevill's Feast. See Rabelais, IV. c. 60. and I conceive that the
_Balænæ_ in Mr. Topham's MS. means the Porpus.

Q.

Quare. 5. It seems to mean to quarter, or to square, to cut to pieces
however, and may be the same as to _dyce_. 10. 60. Dice at this time
were very small: a large parcel of them were found under the floor of
the hall of one of the Temples, about 1764, and were so minute as to
have dropt at times through the chinks or joints of the boards. There
were near 100 pair of ivory, scarce more than two thirds as large as
our modern ones. The hall was built in the reign of Elizabeth. To
_quare_ is from the Fr. quarrer; and _quayre_ or _quaire_, subst. in
Chaucer, Skelton, p. 91. 103. is a book or pamphlet, from the paper
being in the quarto form. See Annal. Dunstap. p. 215, Ames, Typ.
Antiq. p. 3. 9. Hence our quire of paper. The later French wrote
_cahier_, _cayer_, for I presume this may be the same word. Hence,
_kerve hem to dyce_, into small squares, 12. _Dysis_, MS. Ed. 15.

splendid entertainments, if Apicius is to be underslood of it. Lib. I.
c. 1. See Lister, ad loc. and in the middle before the second course;
Lel. Coll. IV. p. 227. and at the end. It was in use at St. John's
Coll. Cambr. 50 years ago, and brought in at Christmas at the close
of dinner, as anciently most usually it was. It took its name from
_Hippocrates' sleeve_, the bag or strainer, through which it was
passed. Skinner, v. Claret; and Chaucer. or as Junius suggests,
because strained _juxta doctrinam Hippocratis_. The Italians call it
_hipocrasso_. It seems not to have differed much from _Piment_, or
Pigment (for which see Chaucer) a rich spiced wine which was sold by
Vintners about 1250. Mr. Topham's MS. Hippocras was both white and
red. Rabelais, IV. c. 59. and I find it used for sauce to lampreys.
Ibid. c. 60.

There is the process at large for making ypocrasse in a MS. of my
respectable Friend Thomas Astle, esq. p. 2. which we have thought
proper to transcribe, as follows:

'To make Ypocrasse for lords with gynger, synamon, and graynes sugour,
and turefoll: and for comyn pepull gynger canell, longe peper, and
claryffyed hony. Loke ye have feyre pewter basens to kepe in your
pouders and your ypocrasse to ren ynne. and to vi basens ye muste
have vi renners on a perche as ye may here see. and loke your poudurs
and your gynger be redy and well paryd or hit be beton in to poudr.
Gynger colombyne is the best gynger, mayken and balandyne be not so
good nor holsom.... now thou knowist the propertees of Ypocras. Your
poudurs must be made everyche by themselfe, and leid in a bledder in
store, hange sure your perche with baggs, and that no bagge twoyche
other, but basen twoyche basen. The fyrst bagge of a galon, every on
of the other a potell. Fyrst do in to a basen a galon or ij of
redwyne, then put in your pouders, and do it in to the renners, and
so in to the seconde bagge, then take a pece and assay it. And yef
hit be eny thyng to stronge of gynger alay it withe synamon, and yef
it be strong of synamon alay it withe sugour cute. And thus schall ye
make perfyte Ypocras. And loke your bagges be of boltell clothe, and
the mouthes opyn, and let it ren in v or vi bagges on a perche, and
under every bagge a clene basen. The draftes of the spies is good for
sewies. Put your Ypocrase in to a stanche wessell, and bynde opon the
mouthe a bleddur strongly, then serve forthe waffers and Ypocrasse.'

Since the foregoing sheets were printed off, the following very curious
Rolls have happily fallen into the Editor's hand, by the favour of John
Charles Brooke, Esq. Somerset Herald.  They are extracted from a MS.
belonging to the family of Nevile of Chevet, near Wakefield, com. Ebor. and
thence copied, under the direction of the Rev. Richard Kay, D.D. Prebendary
of Durham.

These Rolls are so intimately connected with our subject, as exhibiting the
dishes of which our Roll of _Cury_ teaches dressing and preparation, that
they must necessarily be deemed a proper appendix to it.  They are moreover
amusing, if not useful, in another respect; _viz_. as exhibiting the
gradual prices of provisions, from the dates of our more ancient lists, and
the time when these Rolls were composed, in the reign of Henry VIII.  For
the further illustration of this subject, and extract from the old
Account-Book of _Luton_, 19 _Hen_. VIII is super-added; where the prices of
things in the South, at the same period, may be seen.  And whoever pleases
to go further into this matter of _prices_, may compare them with the
particulars and expence of a dinner at Stationer's-Hall, A.D. 1556. which
appeared in the St. James's Chronicle of April 22, 1780.

We cannot help thinking that, upon all accounts, the additions here
presented to our friends must needs prove exceedingly acceptable to them.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
